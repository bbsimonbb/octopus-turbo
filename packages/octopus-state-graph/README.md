# Octopus State Graph

### Modelling your UI as a directed acyclic graph.

## pnpm
pnpm install => turbo dev

## devtools
DO NOT MISS the devtools extension. You can visualise the graph of your UI, see in real time what nodes your interacting with, what value they publish, and navigate directly to the source. It's not in the Chrome store yet, so you'll need to download and build [the project](https://github.com/bbsimonbb/octopus-devtools), then Extensions => Pack extension
